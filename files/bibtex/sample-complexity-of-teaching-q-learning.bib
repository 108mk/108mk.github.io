This is distinct from the teaching-by-demonstration paradigm motivated by robotics applications, where the teacher teaches by providing demonstrations of state/action trajectories. The teaching-by-reinforcement paradigm applies to a wider range of real-world settings where a demonstration is inconvenient, but has not been studied systematically. In this paper, we focus on a specific family of reinforcement learning algorithms, Q-learning, and characterize the TDim under different teachers with varying control power over the environment, and present matching optimal teaching algorithms. Our TDim results provide the minimum number of samples needed for reinforcement learning, and we discuss their connections to standard PAC-style RL sample complexity and teaching-by-demonstration sample complexity results. Our teaching algorithms have the potential to speed up RL agent learning in applications where a helpful teacher is available.}, number={12}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Zhang, Xuezhou and Bharti, Shubham and Ma, Yuzhe and Singla, Adish and Zhu, Xiaojin}, year={2021}, month={May}, pages={10939-10947} }
