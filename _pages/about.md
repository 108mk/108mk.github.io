## Let's learn a bit about Qubit!!!

$\bigstar$ First of all, welcome to my web page! $\bigstar$

I am a second year Masters student of [Quantum Technology](https://iqti.iisc.ac.in/) at [IISc Bengaluru](https://iisc.ac.in/). I am currently working under [Prof. Apooorva Patel](https://chep.iisc.ac.in/Personnel/adpatel.html), aiming to understand the potential application of quantum algorithms.

Before this, I completed my undergrad (BSMS) in Physics from [IIT Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in), where Prof [Manas Khan](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~mkhan/) supervised me on Brownian dynamics simulation.[[Github Repo](https://github.com/108mk/Random-Walk-Simulation-to-study-Anamolous-Diffusion.git)]

My current research interest broadly lies in the implementation of Quantum algorithms in:
- Quantum Hamiltonian Simulation (for certain ODEs and PDEs)
- Optimization (Machine Learning Models & Logistics)

Apart from that, I (occasionally) spend time to familiarize myself with (post) quantum cryptography and error-correcting codes.

I occasionally write blogs to gauge my understanding of Physics, Maths and (Quantum) Computation. You can find them in the [[blog section](https://108mk.github.io/blog/).]

> Major objective of the webpage:

$\spadesuit$ Glimpse to the significant research frontiers in Quantum Computing (QC)

$\clubsuit$ Career opportunities in QC

$\diamondsuit$ To hear from the audience about QC...
