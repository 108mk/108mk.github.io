## Welcome to my homepage!

I am a fourth PhD student in the department of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) at [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), where I am being advised by [Prof. Jerry Zhu](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/index.html). Previously, I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIT Kanpur](https://cse.iitk.ac.in) where I was supervised by [Prof. Piyush Rai](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/) and [Prof. Harish Karnick](https://iitk.ac.in/new/dr-harish-karnick).

My research interest lies broadly in Machine Learning spanning topics in  Reinforcement Learning, Adversarial Learning, Machine Teaching and Fairness.
In my free time, I enjoy cooking, yoga and running. 

You can reach me at first_name_initial+last_name at wisc.edu.
