## A bit about Qubit!!!

$\bigstar$ First of all welcome to my web page! $\bigstar$

I am a second year Masters student of [Quantum Technology](https://iqti.iisc.ac.in/) at [IISc Bengaluru](https://iisc.ac.in/). 
Before this, I completed my undergrad (BSMS) in Physics from [IIT Kanpur](https://cse.iitk.ac.in) where I was supervised by [Prof. Manas Khan](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~mkhan/) on Brownian synamics simulation.

My current research interest broadly lies in the implementation of Qauntum algorithms in:
- Deep learning
- Combinatorial optimization
- Quantum simulation and 
- Quantum information theory

Apart from that, I (occasionaly) spend time to familiarize myself with (post) quantum cryptography and error correcting codes.

I think playing sports is a nice idea. For me it is mostly Badminton and (gully) cricket.
