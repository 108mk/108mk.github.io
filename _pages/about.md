I am a first year Masters student of [Quantum Technology](https://iqti.iisc.ac.in/) at [IISc Bengaluru](https://iisc.ac.in/). Previously, I completed my Bachelors and Masters in Physics from [IIT Kanpur](https://cse.iitk.ac.in) where I was supervised by [Prof. Manas Khan](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~mkhan/).

My research interest lies broadly in Statistical physics, Qauntum Algorithms and Cryptography.
I think playing sports is an equally nice idea. For me it is mostly Badminton.
