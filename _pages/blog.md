#Post1: "Quantum Algorithm Zoo: Here lies (Classically) unseen monsters!"
For a long time, I was searching for a website for a list of quantum algorithms which should be:
>
$\spadesuit$ up-to-date
> 
$\clubsuit$ extensive
> 
$\heartsuit$ and having proper citations for claims
>
I think our search ends with the below website maintained by Stephen Jordon (Google Quantum Research):
> $\Rightarrow$ [Quantum Algorithm Zoo](https://quantumalgorithmzoo.org/)

Oracle Separation of BQP and PH [Raz-Tal, 2018]

This paper is remarkable for two reasons:
> 1. Under the "Oracle setting", there is "a problem" that can be efficiently solved by Quantum Computer (BQP class). Still, the problem lies outside the entire classical Polynomial-time hierarchy (PH class)!!! Or, the problem is (probably) beyond the reach of classical computers, even if, in the future, someone proves or disproves P = NP. 
> 2. A breakthrough of such magnitude (in Quantum complexity theory) happened last time almost a decade ago. The progress in the field seemed to stagnate. But now some quantum complexity theorists are calling that we live in the "post-Raz-Tal world".
