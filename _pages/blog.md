For a long time, I was searching for a website for a list of quantum algorithms which should be:
>
$\spadesuit$ up-to-date
> 
$\clubsuit$ extensive
> 
$\heartsuit$ and having proper citations for claims
>
I think our search ends with the below website maintained by Stephen Jordon (Google Quantum Research):
> $\Rightarrow$ [Quantum Algorithm Zoo](https://quantumalgorithmzoo.org/)

Oracle Separation of BQP and PH [Raz-Tal, 2018]

This paper is remarkable for two reasons:
> 1. Under the Oracle setting, there is "a problem" that can be efficiently solved by Quantum Computer (BQP class), but the problem lies outside the entire Polynomial-time hierarchy (PH class)!
> 2. A breakthrough of such magnitude (in Quantum complexity theory) almost happened almost a decade ago. The progress in the field seemed to stagnate. But quantum complexity theorists can (arguably) say we live in the "post-Raz-Tal world".
