For a long time, i was searching for a website for a list of quantum algorithms which should be:
>
$\spadesuit$ up-to-date
> 
$\clubsuit$ extensive
> 
$\heartsuit$ and, having proper citation for claims
>
I think our search ends with the below website mentained by Stephen Jordon (Google Quantum Research):
>> [Qunatum Algorithm Zoo](https://quantumalgorithmzoo.org/)
